## Known Issues & Limitations

### Minor Issues
1. **Mobile Drag & Drop:** Desktop-only (touch events not implemented)
2. **Large Canvas Export:** PNG export may freeze UI for very large canvases (>500 nodes)
3. **SVG Custom Nodes:** Only basic node shapes supported in SVG export

### Workarounds
1. **Mobile:** Use bulk actions + move to folder instead of drag-and-drop
2. **Large Canvas:** Use JSON export instead, or export in smaller sections
3. **SVG Nodes:** Use PNG export for complex node designs

### Future Enhancements
- Touch-friendly drag & drop
- Web Worker-based PNG export for large canvases
- Advanced SVG export with custom node rendering
- Undo/redo for drag operations
- Bulk drag-and-drop

## Security Considerations

### Phase 2 Security
1. **Bulk Delete:** Validates user owns notes before deletion
2. **Bulk Move:** Validates user owns folder before moving
3. **URL Summarization:** Server-side URL validation and sanitization
4. **Search Delete:** Auth-protected endpoint with ownership checks
5. **Guest Upgrade:** Secure Supabase Auth flow, no plaintext passwords

### Phase 3 Security
1. **Analytics:** User-scoped queries, no data leakage between users
2. **Canvas Export:** Client-side only, no server uploads
3. **Canvas Share:** Optional public sharing with unique share_id
4. **Drag & Drop:** API validates folder ownership before move

### Security Audit Results ✅
- No SQL injection vulnerabilities
- No XSS attack vectors
- Proper CORS configuration
- Auth middleware on all sensitive endpoints
- Input validation on all forms
- Rate limiting on API routes (Vercel defaults)
