# Test Report — October 27, 2025

## Summary
- Test Suites: 13 passed, 13 total
- Tests: 66 passed, 66 total
- Snapshots: 0
- Time: ~3s (local CI run)

All current unit and integration tests are passing.

## What’s covered
- API Routes
  - /api/summarize — request validation, guest mode behavior, logged-in save flow (DB mocked)
  - /api/search — validation, embedding pipeline invocation (mocked), Supabase RPC (mocked)
  - /api/transcribe — file upload handling, transcription with Groq SDK (mocked)
  - /api/workspaces — auth gating and listing (Supabase singleton mocked)
  - /api/folders — auth gating and listing/creation (Supabase singleton mocked)

- Libraries / Utilities
  - lib/logger — levels, metadata, request/response logging
  - lib/encryption — encrypt/decrypt, password hashing/verification
  - lib/calendarLinks — provider URL formats and ICS generation
  - lib/utils — className merger (cn) behavior and conflicts
  - lib/supabase — client initialization shape
  - lib/i18n — resource presence and basic key checks
  - lib/groq — summary structure contract (SDK mocked)
  - lib/guestMode — usage and limits

## Key test infrastructure
- Test runner: Jest (jsdom environment)
- Setup file: `jest.setup.js`
  - Provides window and speech API stubs
  - Adds minimal Web API polyfills needed for Next.js routes in Jest:
    - Response.json static helper (when missing)
  - Mocks env vars for Supabase and Groq SDK

- ESM/SDK mocks (to avoid importing heavy browser-incompatible code):
  - `@xenova/transformers` (pipeline) — mocked factory returning a small vector
  - `groq-sdk` — mocked factory returning predictable responses
  - `@/lib/supabase` — mocked singleton for routes using it directly

## How to run
- Run all tests:

```bash
npm test
```

- Optional: include coverage report locally:

```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

Coverage thresholds are configured in `jest.config.js` (global 50% for branches/functions/lines/statements). Adjust as we expand tests.

## Notes and learnings
- Next.js Response helpers (NextResponse.json) expect a compatible `Response.json` static method in the environment. We added a minimal shim in `jest.setup.js` so route handlers work seamlessly in Jest.
- ESM-only packages (e.g., `@xenova/transformers`) must be mocked before importing route modules to prevent Jest from attempting to parse their source.
- For server-only SDKs (`groq-sdk`), tests mock the module or the higher-level wrapper (`@/lib/groq`) before dynamically importing the route that uses them.
- Where appropriate, assertions focus on HTTP status for validation failures to avoid environment-specific body shape differences.

## Quality gates
- Build: PASS (project builds successfully)
- Lint/Typecheck: PASS (no TypeScript errors in tests or source)
- Tests: PASS (13/13 suites, 66/66 tests)

## Next steps
- Add component tests (SummarizerApp, FolderSidebar, WorkspaceManager, AnalyticsDashboard, CanvasEditor) with proper session/context mocks.
- Expand API tests to canvases, templates, analytics, and share routes.
- Add security and authorization tests (RLS expectations, workspace permissions).
- Increase coverage thresholds once breadth is complete.
