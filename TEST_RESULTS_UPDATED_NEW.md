## Test improvements summary

### What was added
- **18 new test files** (11 API routes, 7 components)
- **75 new test cases** (from 94 to 169)
- **Coverage thresholds raised** from (20/30/35/35) to (39/43/50/50)

### Coverage improvements
- Lines: +54% increase (35.34% → 54.48%)
- Branches: +82% increase (21.91% → 39.68%)
- Functions: +39% increase (30.98% → 43.09%)
- Statements: +59% increase (35% → 55.74%)

### Quality gates
- ✅ All 169 tests passing
- ✅ Code review: No issues found
- ✅ Security scan: No vulnerabilities detected
- ✅ Coverage thresholds met and enforced

## Key test infrastructure
- Test runner: Jest (jsdom environment)
- Setup file: `jest.setup.js`
  - Provides window and speech API stubs
  - Adds minimal Web API polyfills needed for Next.js routes in Jest
  - Mocks env vars for Supabase and Groq SDK

- ESM/SDK mocks (to avoid importing heavy browser-incompatible code):
  - `@xenova/transformers` (pipeline) — mocked factory returning a small vector
  - `groq-sdk` — mocked factory returning predictable responses
  - `@/lib/supabase` — mocked singleton for routes using it directly

## How to run
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage report
npm test -- --coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- SearchBar.test.tsx

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test:watch
```

## Next steps (optional enhancements)
- Add tests for SummarizerApp (main app component)
- Add tests for useSpeech and useVoiceInput hooks
- Add tests for remaining API routes (notes/[id]/share, share/[shareId])
- Increase coverage thresholds further as needed
